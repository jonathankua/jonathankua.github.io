<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am currently a Lecturer in Internet of Things within the School of Information Technology at <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/">Deakin University</a> in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>I completed my PhD in Telecommunications Engineering within the School of Software and Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au">Swinburne University of Technology</a>, under the primary supervision of <a href="http://i4t.swin.edu.au/people/garmitage">Prof Grenville Armitage</a> and <a href="http://i4t.swin.edu.au/people/pbranch">A/Prof Philip Branch</a>.
My PhD was industrially funded and supported by <a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/">Netflix, Inc</a>. I was previously affiliated with the <a href="http://caia.swin.edu.au">Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures</a> and the <a href="http://i4t.swin.edu.au">Internet For Things Research Group</a> at Swinburne.</p>
<p>During my time at Swinburne, I studied the intricate interactions between Internet-based adaptive streaming systems and bottleneck active queue management (AQM) schemes, and developed a suite of novel client-side techniques that leverages the properties of emerging AQMs to optimise the user experience of video streaming applications.</p>
<p>My PhD research was internationally recognised with a second runner-up of the <a href="https://multimediacommunication.blogspot.com/2019/06/dash-if-awarded-best-phd-dissertation.html">DASH-IF Best PhD Dissertation Award on “Algorithms and Protocols for Adaptive Content Delivery over the Internet”</a> and commended locally within the University with the 2019 Swinburne Outstanding Thesis Award.</p>
<h2>Research interests</h2>
<p>My research interests are in the broad areas of computer systems and data networking, network measurement, adaptive multimedia streaming, content delivery, transport protocols and bottleneck buffer/queue management techniques.
I am also interested in the emerging areas of the Internet of Things, distributed computing and networked systems, with an overarching focus of improving the user experience and quality of service of the Internet.</p>
